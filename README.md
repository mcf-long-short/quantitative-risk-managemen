### Convertable Bonds

In the `Convertable Bonds/` directory you may find Jupyter Notebooks containing models and calculations for:

- Analysing correlation between Credit and Equity indices to understand the systemic risk
- Convertible Bond pricing and risks
- Mandatory Convertible Bonds (PERCS and DECS) pricing
